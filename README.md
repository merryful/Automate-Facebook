## About The Project

I was on facetime with my sister one day, she had mentioned that she just posted an annoucement on her facebook page saying 
that she was pregnant. I'm sure she had over 50 comments under that post congrautaling her. She then told me she was going to 
have to take some time to reply to everyone and I thought, don't you wish there was a way to respond "Thank You" to everyone without 
having to manually respond to each comment?
